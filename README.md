# NotesApp-Django

###### As you already know from the name, this is just a normal notes app, that was made with Python and Django

## Features

###### Well, apart from it's sadistic bad design (thanks to my  design skills), it's basically a CRUD app (I think)
It works with the Create, Read, Update and Delete of  CRUD operations so I think I'm in the right there...ðŸ˜…
###### Something else?
There's also the user accounts, so there's login, logout functionality and basic sign up and stuff. It was just a project I did to test myself when I was first starting out with Django

## Plans
I plan on creating the front end with reactJS and also adding a to-do list feature later on... P.S: There's barely any comments in the code, I'm so sorryðŸ˜”
